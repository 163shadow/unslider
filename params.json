{"name":"Unslider","body":"# Unslider\r\n### A jQuery slider that just slides.\r\n\r\nIf you want to have a quick, lightweight slider, with just the arrows and no fancy effects, then you'll love Unslider. Weighing in at 4kb uncompressed, and 1.9kb compressed, it's an incredibly lightweight solution.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Slides a list\r\n* Supports any HTML content (within a list item)\r\n* Keyboard support\r\n\r\nThat's it!\r\n\r\n## Quickstart\r\nTo begin using Unslider, just include the files, and create a `div` with an unordered list (`ul`) inside.\r\n\r\nPretty straightforward, and nice and semantic. Lovely. Now, we need a touch of CSS as well:\r\n```css\r\n.unslider {\r\n\toverflow: hidden;\r\n}\r\n\t.unslider ul {\r\n\t\tposition: relative;\r\n\t}\r\n\t.unslider li {\r\n\t\tfloat: left;\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n_This is the same as the contents for unslider.css, so if you're including that file, don't add this CSS._\r\n\r\nNow that it's all set up, you just need to call the `unslider` method, with any options. They're optional, though, so you don't need to \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n//  Vanilla install\r\n$('#slider').unslider();\r\n\r\n//  And any options\r\n$('#slider').unslider({\r\n    //  Options go here.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Options\r\nIt's also got a few options. Here are the defaults:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n\tactiveClass: 'active', //  The class of the active slide\r\n\tarrows: true, //  Choose whether to show the arrows in the markup or not\r\n\t\r\n\t//  Speeds + timing\r\n\tspeed: 250,\r\n\tdelay: 2000,\r\n\tautoplay: true, //  Should the slider autoplay?\r\n\teasing: 'swing', //  A jQuery easing string (see the Easing plugin for more: http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/)\r\n\t\r\n\t//  Callbacks\r\n\tafterSlide: function() {} //  Called after a slide has occured.\r\n}\r\n```","tagline":"The simplest jQuery slider there is.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
